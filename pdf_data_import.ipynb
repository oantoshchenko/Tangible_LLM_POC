    "This is a POC (Proof Of Concept), that intent to show that existing LLM (Large Language Models) can be used to extract data from a PDF **without a need to develop specialized models**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## POC Description\n",
    "This POC will:\n",
    "1. Extract text from a PDF document\n",
    "2. Formulate query to Open AI's  `text-davinci-003` model via an API call using text extracted from PDF\n",
    "3. Parse the API response into python dictionary\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, I will be using a PDF downloaded from [Renewed Materials website](http://www.renewedmaterials.com/alkemi-copper).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goal\n",
    "Prove that it is possible to use existing LLMs like GPT3 to extract data from natural language documents (PDFs, web pages, etc.) to get structural data for further manipulation.\n",
    "The last step will prove that data is parsed and available for further programmatic usage, like storing in a database or further processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to use this\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a [Jupiter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) a tool used mostly for data science rapid prototyping. To run it as-is read more on the [Jupiter website](https://jupyter.org/)\n",
    "\n",
    "*Alternatively* the code from the notebook might be copied to a regular python file and executed from there.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "1. This code has few dependencies (described in `requirements.txt`), and can be installed via pip or any other python dependency management you like\n",
    "2. It requires an API key to call Open AI's API (I won't be sharing mine ;) ) to be set in environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY`. Read more about Open AI's API [here](https://beta.openai.com/docs/introduction)\n"
